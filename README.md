Connection application between teachers and parents is an app designed to allow teachers to easily communicate with parents about their student's progress. The app allows for direct messaging, making it easy for both parties to stay in touch on any changes or updates regarding the student's performance. It also allows for the sharing of important documents, such as the student's report card, without the need for physical copies. Additionally, teachers can create events or announcements that alert parents when something is happening. This app provides a convenient way for teachers and parents to stay connected and work together to ensure their student's success.
